1. TrainModel.py - (Training the Classification Model)
Purpose:
This script prepares and trains a convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier to recognize different categories of images.

Workflow:
Loading Image Data:

Reads images from the "dataset" directory.
Resizes them to 32x32 pixels.
Stores image data and labels in NumPy arrays.
Converts labels into categorical form.
Preprocessing:

Normalizes image pixel values to 0-1 range.
Saves processed image data (img_data.txt) and labels (img_label.txt).
Defining the CNN Model:

Uses a Sequential model.
Applies Convolutional and MaxPooling layers.
Flattens the data and adds Dense layers.
Uses softmax activation to classify images into 5 categories.
Training:

Trains the model for 50 epochs with a batch size of 32.
Saves trained model weights in "model/train.h5".
Saves the model architecture in "model/train.json".



2. GANModel.py - (Training the GAN Model)
Purpose:
This script creates and trains a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate synthetic images.

Workflow:
Define the Discriminator Model:

Uses Convolutional layers to classify real vs. fake images.
Uses LeakyReLU activation and Dropout to prevent overfitting.
Uses Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss.
Define the Generator Model:

Takes random noise (latent space) as input.
Uses Conv2DTranspose layers to upsample images.
Outputs synthetic 32x32 RGB images using tanh activation.
Define the GAN Model:

Combines generator + discriminator.
Discriminator is set not trainable while training the GAN.
Uses binary cross-entropy loss.
Training the GAN:

Loads real images from "img_data.txt.npy".
Generates real and fake samples.
Trains the discriminator and generator in alternating steps.
Saves the generator model every 10 epochs (e.g., "generator_model_010.h5").
Saves generated images in "model/generated_plot_eXXX.png".


3. GeneratePredict.py - (Generating and Predicting Images)
Purpose:
This script generates new images using the trained GAN and classifies them using the trained CNN.

Workflow:
Loading the Trained CNN Model:

Reads the CNN model structure (train.json).
Loads the saved weights (train.h5).
Generating Images Using the GAN:

Loads a pre-trained generator (e.g., "generator_model_080.h5").
Creates latent vectors as input.
Generates synthetic images.
Classifying Generated Images:

Reshapes generated images.
Passes them through the trained CNN.
Predicts the class label.
Displaying Predictions:

Shows the generated image with the predicted label.
Overall Execution Order

Run TrainModel.py → Train and save the CNN model.
Run GANModel.py → Train and save the GAN generator.
Run GeneratePredict.py → Generate images and predict their category






1. CNN Model (TrainModel.py) - Uses the Dataset for Classification
The CNN classifier is trained to recognize categories of images.
It loads images from the "dataset" folder, processes them, and saves them as NumPy arrays:
img_data.txt.npy → Contains processed image data.
img_label.txt.npy → Contains corresponding labels (converted to categorical form).
✅ Purpose: The CNN learns to classify real images.

2. GAN Model (GANModel.py) - Uses the Same Dataset to Train the Generator
The GAN loads the same dataset (img_data.txt.npy) to train the discriminator.
The discriminator is trained to distinguish real images (from the dataset) from fake images (generated by the GAN).
✅ Purpose: The GAN learns to generate images similar to the real ones.

3. GeneratePredict.py - Uses the GAN and CNN Together
Step 1: The trained GAN generator creates new fake images.
Step 2: The CNN classifier (trained in TrainModel.py) predicts the category of the generated images.
✅ Purpose: The pipeline generates new images and classifies them using the CNN.

Final Connection
CNN (TrainModel.py) → Trains on real images.
GAN (GANModel.py) → Trains to generate new images using the same dataset.
Prediction (GeneratePredict.py) → Uses the trained CNN to classify GAN-generated images.
